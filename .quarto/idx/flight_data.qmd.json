{"title":"Purpose","markdown":{"headingText":"Purpose","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"**E178: Spring 2024 Final Project**\n\n<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">|[home](index.html)|[syllabus](syllabus.html)|[assignments](assignments.html)|[labs](labs.html)|[final project](final_project.html)|[flight data](flight_data.html)|[getting certified](getting_certified.html)|</span>\n    \nThe purpose of the Final Project is to give you a chance to demonstrate the lessons you\nhave learned during the semester (and during your time at Mudd) and put them into practice\nduring a series of four flights over two launches. The project will be conducted in your\nteams of two that you have had throughout the semester.\n\n# Schedule\nIf everything goes according to plan (and it rarely does) there will be two days for flights:\nSaturday, 6 April 2024, and Saturday, 13 April 2024. The reason for the two flight days\nis that, in spite of the best planning, something can go wrong during flights, and it's\nreally useful to have a week to fix the issues you ran into, and get a do-over. With that\npurpose in mind, you should be totally prepped for your first flight on 6 April 2024.\nWe already have our permissions for the 6 April 2024 flights from the BLM and the FAA. To\ngive you the best shot at being ready, here is the schedule of milestones and check-offs\nyou need to meet.\n\n## Calendar\n          Date     | Milestone/Check-Off\n  ----------------:|----------------------\n  Thu, 29 FEB 2024 | Preliminary Design Documents and BOM\n  Tue, 19 MAR 2024 | Complete Design Documents and BOM\n  Thu, 21 MAR 2024 | Milestone 1\n  Tue, 26 MAR 2024 | Milestone 2\n  Thu, 28 MAR 2024 | Milestone 3\n  Tue,  2 APR 2024 | Avionics Tests\n  Thu,  4 APR 2024 | Ground Tests of Ejection Systems, Completed Airframe Construction and Inspection\n  Fri,  5 APR 2024 | Motor Prep, Flight Checklist due, Preflight Inspection\n  Sat,  6 APR 2024 | Class Launch, First Set of Flights\n  Thu, 11 APR 2024 | Analysis of First Set of Flight Data\n  Fri, 12 APR 2024 | Motor Prep, Preflight Inspection\n  Sat, 13 APR 2024 | Class Launch with ROC, Second Set of Flights\n  Thu, 18 APR 2024 | Analysis of Second Set of Flight Data\n  Thu, 25 APR 2024 | Final Reports Due\n\n# Flight Hardware\nYou have the following choices for flight hardware:\n - The standard class rocket, a modified Madcow Adventurer.\n   - The vendor information is [here](https://www.madcowrocketry.com/2-2-fiberglass-adventurer/).\n   - The assembly instructions are [here](ClassRocketAssembly.md.html).\n   - The Open Rocket model is [here](SimModels/ClassAdventurer.ork).\n   - Peak apogee is approximately 10,000 feet AGL.\n   - Peak velocity is approximately 800 mph (Mach 1.05).\n - The previous class rocket, a modified Madcow Go Devil 38.\n   - The vendor information is [here](https://www.madcowrocketry.com/1-6-fiberglass-go-devil/).\n   - The _outdated_ assembly instructions are [here](38mmClassRocketAssembly.md.html).\n   - The Open Rocket model is [here](SimModels/ClassGoDevil38WAvionics.ork).\n   - Peak apogee is approximately 13,500 feet AGL.\n   - Peak velocity is approximately 1190 mph (Mach 1.5).\n - A rocket design of your choice. To select this option _both_ team members _must_ be\n   certified Level 2 by 18 March 2024. **There are NO exceptions.**\n   - The vendor information is TBD.\n   - The assembly instructions are TBD.\n   - The Open Rocket model is TBD.\n   - Peak apogee is limited to 14,500 feet AGL.\n   - Peak velocity is TBD.\n  \n\n# Motors\nOur first launch on 6 April 2024 is by ourselves. The FAA altitude limit is\n14,500 feet AGL. We can use the biggest commercially available motors for theses flights.\nThe second launch will be joint with ROC, as part of Rocstock. Their altitude limit is\n7000 feet AGL and _we cannot violate that limit_. You will need to choose two motors for the\nfirst week and two motors for the second week with the altitude limits in mind. You may\nchoose from among any 38 mm CTI motor up to the 6GXL case, and among the 38 mm Aerotech\nmotors up to the 1080 case. We do have RMS-38/1320 cases but Aerotech quit making the\nJ510W that would fit in them.\nUse Open Rocket to check and choose which motors you want. The sooner you choose them, the sooner\nwe will be able to get them here.\n\n<!-- Inventory\n   #| Motor     | I (Ns) | Brand    | Case     | Team\n  --|-----------|--------|----------|----------|-----\n  2 | J570W-14A | 973.1  | Aerotech | 38/1080  | \n  2 |  J453-16A | 1013   |      CTI | P38-6GXL | \n  1 |  J530-15A | 1115   |      CTI | P38-6GXL |\n\n-->\n\n\n# Check-Offs and Milestones\n  Here is the list of check-offs and milestones with specifications, up to, but not including\n  the first flights.\n  \n## Preliminary Design Documents and BOM\n   I need to see evidence that you will be ready for launch on 6 April 2024.\n   Put together a preliminary flight proposal that describes whether you will use the\n   standard class rocket or a different rocket, what the goals of your project are and\n   how you expect to achieve them, and what you expect the challenges to be.\n   You must include sketches or CAD (Solidworks and/or Rocksim/Open Rocket) drawings/models which\n   show your rocket and any modifications you intend to make. You also need\n   a preliminary bill of materials including what additional items need to be ordered and\n   whether you are going to order them or I am. We will try to get everything ordered as\n   quickly as we can after your plan and budget are approved. If you have any long-lead-time\n   items, let me know about them as early as you can, and we'll order them even\n   before your design documents are approved.\n   \n## Complete Design Documents and BOM\n   You are free to get your design documents approved before the due date. In fact, I\n   would recommend it so you can get an early start on your construction.\n   In addition to the information you put together for your preliminary flight propoasal,\n   you need **complete** CAD (Solidworks and/or Rocksim/Open Rocket) drawings/models which\n   show every detail of the modifications you intend to make to your rocket. You need a\n   list of milestones with dates so I can check on the progress of your project (see below).\n   Finally, you need\n   a **complete** bill of materials including what additional items need to be ordered and\n   whether you are going to order them or I am. We will try to get everything ordered as\n   quickly as we can after your detailed plan and budget are approved. If you have any long\n   lead time items, let me know about them as early as you can, and we'll order them even\n   before your final design documents are approved.\n   \n## Milestones 1 through 3\n   You are responsible for determining a set of milestones that need to be completed to\n   ensure that your project will be flight ready by 8 April 2024 and completed by\n   25 April 2024. You must list the milestones in your Final Plan (Complete Design\n   Documents and BOM). These should include, at a minimum, demonstrating functionality of\n   all of your avionics, such as firing the firewire initiators, and recording data.\n   \n## Completed Airframe Construction and Inspection\n   This deadline is rather tight if you haven't gotten approval for your plans earlier than\n   the plan-approval deadline. You need to have all of the mechanical modifications to your rocket\n   completed by this deadline. I need to inspect the rocket for flight-worthiness. This\n   check-off is important. If you miss the timeline, you may not have time to get your rocket\n   prepared in time for the first launch.\n   \n## Ground Tests of Ejection Systems, Complete Flight Checklists\n   You need to test to determine the correct black powder amounts for the\n   drogue chute to eject at apogee, and the main to eject at 200 meters. The testing will\n   be conducted on Linde Field, and we need to notify Campus Safety when you are going to\n   test. The details of ground testing your ejection systems are found in the\n   [Class Rocket Assembly Instructions](ClassRocketAssembly.md.html#testingejectioncharges),\n   which have not yet been updated for the class modified Adventurers.\n   \n   You also need to have your checklists approved. Your first checklist should be for\n   prepping your rocket for flight. A starting point is the\n   [Class Rocket Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dVBvO7aVfs_-7mEDtWGHkoOWV-Q9yQn5qkdvQN47Fl4/template/preview)\n   You also need a checklist for everything you need to bring to the launch. You can have\n   other checklists if you want. Many of the times that something goes wrong on a flight,\n   it is due to someone not following the checklist.\n   \n## First Launch Motors Prepped, Preflight Inspection\n   It is possible to prep your motors in the field on launch day. However, it's usually\n   better to prep them in the lab before you leave, where you are under less stress and\n   there is substantially less dust blowing around. Just remember to leave them a little\n   less than fully tightened, so that the o-rings don't take a set (ask NASA about that).\n   However, you do need to fully tighten them before you put them in the rocket on launch\n   day.\n   \n   I need to inspect your rocket and make sure it's ready to launch before we load up to\n   go to the launch site. It's best to have it inspected early enough that you have time to fix\n   any problems I find. \n   \n   Hopefully, the remaining milestones and deadlines are self-explanatory.\n  \n# Flight Characterization\n  You have several decisions to make regarding your final project. You will nominally get two flights\n  on each of two Saturdays (6 April 2024 and 13 April 2024) to generate flight data for your\n  Final Report. The Final Report must demonstrate competency in each of the following areas:\n\n - Characterization of flight and flow dynamics on each flight (e.g., trajectory, apogee, $C_D$, etc.)\n - Characterization of motor performance on each flight (e.g, thrust curve, total and specific impulse)\n  \n  To demonstrate competency, you need the following plots included in your Final Report,\n  one such plot per flight:\n  \n  1. Acceleration, the measured vertical acceleration from lift-off to apogee on the same plot\n     as the modeled acceleration.\n  2. Velocity, the measured vertical velocity from lift-off to apogee on the same plot\n     as the modeled velocity.\n  3. Altitude, the measured altitude from lift-off to apogee on the same plot\n     as the modeled altitude.\n  4. Spin Rate, the measured spin rate about the vertical axis of the rocket from lift-off\n     to apogee.\n  5. Orientation, the measured orientation about the vertical axis of the rocket from\n     lift-off to apogee.\n  6. A plot showing calculation of the average $C_D$.\n  7. A plot showing $C_D$ versus velocity.\n  8. A plot showing the measured thrust curve of the rocket on the same plot as the\n     thrust curve from thrustcurve.org.\n  9. A plot showing the calculated rocket mass vs. time from lift-off to burnout on the\n     same plot as the modeled curve.\n  10. If possible a plot showing exterior temperature versus time, and a plot showing\n     exterior temperature versus altitude during descent with both a best-fit line, and\n     a best-fit line with the standard lapse rate.\n     \n  You may combine plots, for example Plots 1, 2, and 3, if you believe it clarifies what\n  is happening.\n  \n  In addition, you may, if desired, demonstrate an in-depth understanding of either one of\n  the above areas or one of the following areas:\n \n - Characterization of avionics and telemetry\n - Characterization of structural dynamics (e.g, PSD plots of on-board accelerometers)\n - Fluid mechanics and CFD\n - Risk and reliability\n - Other areas of your interest\n  \n## Sample in-depth design areas:\n\n   * Lower body tube with custom sets of fins\n   * Custom instrumentation and sensors such as telemetry system, vibration measurement system, etc.\n   * Custom signal-processing software\n   * System for active stabilization (not guidance)\n\n# Final Report\n  The final report should be an in-depth discussion of your project, from design and\n  modeling, through analysis of flight data, to conclusions. It should be no more than\n  ten (10) pages in total length with an 11-point font, including all figures and\n  references. The [Tech Memo Guidelines](TechMemoGuide.md.html) explains\n  more about the expected format. The Report will be graded according to [this rubric](PDF/FinalReportRubric2024.pdf).\n  The Final Report is a team report, not an individual report, so you should work on it\n  together.\n  \n# Partial List of Previous Projects\n\n## Boosted Dart\n   Attempt to launch a boosted dart with a 3-motor cluster booster.\n     \n   **Results:** Failed to launch due to structural integrity issues (side casings snapped off\n   during launch prep). One of team was proctor following year and launched during\n   class launch. Never recovered boosted dart or avionics.\n\n## Two-Stage Minimum Diameter Rocket.\n   **Results:** 2nd stage failed to ignite due to\n   design and avionics flaws. Top stage flew by itself flawlessly.\n\n## Spring-Loaded Parachute Ejection\n   Designed a spring loaded mechanical release for parachute ejection, both drogue and main.\n   \n   **Results:** 1st Launch functioned properly. There was irreparable structural failure\n   of the rocket body where the side-ejection door had been cut on the 2nd flight.\n   \n## Measurement of Temperature Profile Along Rocket Body\n   Attempted to pur an array of temperature sensors along the outside of the rocket body\n   to measure the air-temperature profile during transonic flight.\n   \n   **Results:** Never managed to get their custom Teensy-based data acquisition system\n   to function properly and record data. Never flew.\n   \n## Sensor Fusion\n   Attempted to combine multi-camera video data for horizon with IMU data to provide better 3-D\n   sensor fusion.\n   \n   **Results:** Partially successful, but incorrectly set sample rates for IMU and\n   did not have high-enough quality data for successful sensor fusion.\n\n## Vibration Senors Along Body\n   Placed an array of vibrations sensors on the surface of the rocket to measure modal\n   vibrations.\n   \n   **Resuts:** Struggled with both the avionics and the flight preparation and never flew.\n   \n## Gyro Stabilized\n   _E80 Project_: Included a high-speed gyroscope in the rocket to maintain the orientation\n   during flight\n   \n   **Results:** Got the gyro to spin up, but it didn't seem to have much effect.\n\n## Fin Drag for Different Fin Shapes and Placement\n   _E80 Project_: Made the fin can easily detachable and changeable to attach different fins.\n   \n   **Results:** Very successful. Managed to get a lot of fin drag vs. velocity data for\n   different fins.\n   \n## Variations in UV Intensity with Altitude\n   _E80 Project_: Placed a set of UV sensitive photodiodes on the rocket to measure UV\n   intensity vs. altitude and compare with models.\n   \n   **Results:** Were unsuccessful in measuring changes with UV intensity with altitude\n   because of rocket rotation, but found a really accurate way to measure axial rocket\n   rotation.\n   \n## Mapping of Wind Velocity vs. Altitude\n   _E80 Project_: Designed a rocket to drop a series of small weighted objects with parachutes\n   at different altitudes and map out the wind velocity versus altitude by where the\n   objects landed.\n   \n   **Results:** Never got the ejection mechanism to work reliably. Got very few data points\n   and were unable to map things well.\n
