{"title":"Working Spaces","markdown":{"headingText":"Working Spaces","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"**E178: High-Power Rocketry – Syllabus**\n *Spring 2024* - [Harvey Mudd College](http://www.hmc.edu) - [Department of Engineering](https://www.hmc.edu/engineering/)\n  Prof. [R. Erik Spjut](http://erik.spjut.me), <spjut@g.hmc.edu>\n\n<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">|[home](index.html)|[syllabus](syllabus.html)|[assignments](assignments.html)|[labs](labs.html)|[final project](final_project.html)|[flight data](flight_data.html)|[getting certified](getting_certified.html)|</span>\n\n\nWe will be working in the following spaces:\n * **Shanahan B470:** This is the classroom this semester. We will meet here most Tuesdays and\n   Thursdays.\n * **Parsons B187:** The Rocket Lab. This is where the workbenches, tools, and supplies are kept.\n   It has a fume hood, a sink, and a soldering station. Most of the actual construction of\n   the rockets will take place here\n * **Parsons B171:** The E80 Lab. We have rocket motors and motor casings stored in this lab.\n   You need to ask permission to use supplies, workspaces, or equipment in here.\n * **McGregor Basement:** The Makerspace. If you haven't become certified on the Makerspace equipment,\n   especially the laser cutter and the 3D printers, you should do so. Parts of the rockets\n   are constructed from laser-cut plywood. There is also space for working with composites.\n * **Beckman B101, B102:** The Student Machine Shops. Your life will be much easier if you are\n   able to use the machine shops for working on your rockets.\n\nMy office is Parsons 2384 in the middle of the West hall on the top Floor of Parsons.\nYou can make appointments to ensure I'll be available.\nAlso, feel free to just stop by whenever the sign on my office door says \"Please Knock\"\n(It doesn't actually speak. You have to read it).\nI'm usually here by 7:30 am and stay until at least 3:30 pm.\n\n# Schedule\n\nThe course calendar is on the <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">[home](index.md.html#Calendar)</span> page.\nFor the first two-thirds of the course we will have class meetings on Tuesday and Thursday\nfrom 1:15 pm to 2:30 pm.\nThe labs are due on\nTuesdays by the start of class and the assignments are due on mostly\nThursdays by the start of class. The schedule is\ndesigned to let you ask questions and resolve difficulties in class before the lab or\nassignment is due. The last third of the course will be the\n[Final Project](#courseformat/assignments,labs,exam,andfinalproject/finalproject).\n\nI will not have specific office hours, but you can schedule on-line or in-person meetings, usually with\nvery short notice. I will have delayed responses to emails after 5 pm, and I will not\nrespond until the next morning to emails after 9 pm on week days. I will have delayed\nresponses to emails on Saturdays and I will not respond to emails on Sunday until Monday\nmorning.\n\n## Flight Hardware\n\nYou will be given kits for a [LOC Precision Weasel](https://locprecision.com/collections/rockets-1-63-diameter/products/weasel)\nand a [LOC Precision Vulcanite](https://locprecision.com/product/vulcanite-h76/). Your team\nwill have access to parts for a modified [2.2\" Madcow Adventurer](https://www.madcowrocketry.com/2-2-fiberglass-adventurer/),\na modified [1.6\" Madcow Go Devil](https://www.madcowrocketry.com/1-6-fiberglass-go-devil/),\nor a design of your choice for your [Final Project](finalproject.md.html).\nThe Flight Hardware for the semester is discussed in depth on the\n[Flight Hardware](FlightHardware.md.html) page.\n\n## Actually Getting to Fly\n\nWe have two scheduled launches in E178, one on Saturday, 6 April 2024 by ourselves, and\nthe other at [ROC](https://rocstock.org)\nlaunch on Saturday, 13 April 2024. We have the proper permits for\nour own launch. We will work out transportation for the class to the launches.\n\nIf you want to certify or collect data from your Level 1 and/or Level 2 rockets, you can\nattend the ROC, TV, and TSD launches on dates before our scheduled launches. I will have\nthe HMC Canopies and tables and other\nsupplies at the 10 February 2024 and the 9 March 2024 [ROC](https://rocstock.org) launches.\nYou will be responsible for getting yourselves to the launch. If desired, we can coordinate\ntravel to the [TSD](http://www.tripolisandiego.org) and/or [TV](https://www.tripolivegas.com/) launches.\n\nIt is possible to go by yourself to fly your rockets. For G or smaller motors, in\nCalifornia the requirements are that you use commercial motors certified by the State of\nCalifornia and you have permission of the local landowner and of the local fire department.\nFor high power rockets (H motors and larger) you **must** also have an FAA waiver as well as\npermission from the local authorities. In practical terms, that means that you need to\nfly at a sanctioned launch run by your local [Tripoli](http://www.tripoli.org/) or\n[NAR](https://www.nar.org/) prefecture, club or organization.\nA list of local Tripoli prefectures is [here][TRS]. A map version is [here][TRM].\nA locator for local NAR clubs is [here][NAS]. A map version is [here][NAM]. For\nSouthern California, the closest clubs are:\n - The Rocketry Organization of California ([ROC](https://rocstock.org)),\n - Tripoli San Diego ([TSD](http://www.tripolisandiego.org)),\n - Tripoli Vegas ([TV](https://www.tripolivegas.com/)),\n - and Tripoli Central California ([TCC](http://tccrockets.com/v2/)).\nCheck the respective websites for the latest information.\n\n# Texts\n  - Sampo Niskanen, [*Open Rocket technical documentation*][txt].\n  - Tom Benson, Ed., [*The Beginner's Guide to Rockets*][BegGui], NASA 2014\n  - Oliver J.

The FAA recognizes two classes of amateur\nrockets:\n### Class 1 or Model Rockets\nClass 1 - Model Rocket means an amateur rocket that:\n\n 1. Uses no more than 125 grams (4.4 ounces) of propellant;\n 2. Uses a slow-burning propellant;\n 3. Is made of paper, wood, or breakable plastic;\n 4. Contains no substantial metal parts; and\n 5. Weighs no more than 1,500 grams (53 ounces), including the propellant.\n\n### Class 2 or High Power Rockets\nClass 2 – High-Power Rocket means an amateur rocket other than a model rocket that is\npropelled by a motor or motors having a combined total impulse of 40,960 Newton-seconds\n(9,208 pound-seconds) or less.\nThe National Fire Protection Association also has two codes covering amateur rockets that\ncorrespond closely with the FAA Class 1 and Class 2.\nNFPA 1122 – Model Rocketry\nNFPA 1127 – High Power Rocketry\n\nThee two organizations in the US that sanction High Power Rockets are the National\nAssociation of Rocketry (NAR) and the Tripoli Rocketry Association (TRA). In order to fly\na high power rocket at a NAR or Tripoli sanctioned event, you must be certified. The range\nof rockets you can fly with different certification levels are as follows:\n - No Certification – Rocket up to total mass of 1.500 kg. Total propellant up to 0.125 kg.\n   Average thrust up to 80 N. Total impulse up to 160 Ns (e.g., a G motor).\n - Level 1 Certification – Total Impulse up to 640 Ns (H or I motors).\n - Level 2 Certification – Total Impulse up to 5,120 Ns (J, K or L motors).\n - Level 3 Certification – Total Impulse up to 40,960 Ns (M, N, or O motors). California\n   limits total impulse to 10,240 Ns (M motors).\n\nThis class is geared towards learning to model, build, instrument, fly, and analyze High\nPower Rockets.\n\n## Modeling\nA model is a set of equations or computer code that describes the flight of the rocket.\nThe forces and torques in a rocket model come from gravity, thrust, lift, and drag. Models\nare classified as 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D models. A 1-D model assumes that the rocket flies\nstraight up and falls under parachute straight down. A 2-D (or 3 DoF) model assumes that\nthe rocket can travel vertically and horizontally, and rotate in the 2-D plane of motion.\nA 3-D (or 6 DoF) model assumes that the rocket can travel in 3-D space and rotate about\nany of its three principal axes. The required modeling in E178 is:\n\n 1. Develop or prove an analytic 1-D model with constant thrust during motor burning, and a\n    constant coefficient of drag during the flight.\n 2. Learn to use a 2-D (3 DoF) open source program called Open Rocket to model and predict\n    rocket behavior. Use this code for all three rockets you will construct.\n 3. Develop and/or use a 1-D code to permit calculation of $C_D$ and thrust curves from\n    flight data.\n\n## Building\nDuring the course of the semester you will build two rockets by yourself, and work as part\nof a team to build a third.\n\nThe first rocket is a LOC Weasel, a cardboard, plywood, and\nplastic rocket that will be assembled using 5-minute epoxy and screws. You use 5-minute\nepoxy to acquaint you with proper and safe use of epoxy in rocket building, but with a\nquick cure time. It is suitable for a Level 1 flight.\n\nThe second rocket is a LOC Vulcanite,\nagain a cardboard, plywood, and plastic rocket, but modified to use dual deployment for\nrecovery. It is constructed with Aeropoxy, a slow-curing epoxy that is much stronger than\n5-minute epoxy. It is overkill for the Vulcanite, but it is much trickier to work with than\nthe 5-minute epoxy, and will give you practice for the Final Project rocket.\n\nThe third rocket is for your Final Project. It is a chance to demonstrate everything you've\nlearned during the semester as well as explore some aspect of rocketry that interests you\nin depth.\n\n# Course Format\nSee the [calendar](index.md.html#Calendar) for schedule. The course for 2024 will consist\nof meetings on Tuesdays and Thursdays to discuss and plan the work for the week\nand to discuss the solutions or results for the previous week's work. We will have both\nweekly labs/construction projects and weekly problem-set-style assignments as well as the final\nproject. The deliverables will be due by the start of class on the indicated day. The\nassignment deliverables are due on Gradescope. The lab deliverables vary as to how they\nwill be submitted\n\n**Outside of Class Time**\n    \n    You and/or your team will have to find time to solve the assigned problems, develop\n    the needed models and software, construct the needed hardware, conduct the necessary\n    experiments, analyze the data, and write up the results.\n    This course is a three-unit course, so the catalog expectation is three hours in class\n    and six-to-nine hours outside of class. I would like you to track your hours and let\n    me know if the workload is too excessive.\n\n## Teams\n\nMuch of the work in class will be done in teams of two (or three). We will determine the teams very\nearly in the semester. You may certainly collaborate with each other\non the assignments and labs, either as teams or as a whole class. Each lab and assignment\nwill have a list of deliverables. Even though most of the work in\nclass can be done in teams, each student must \nsubmit individual assignment solutions for Assignments 1 through 7, and individual lab\ndeliverables for Labs 1, 2, 4, & 5. \nYou must work on the Final Project as a team. For Final Projects\nthe Final Report will be submitted by the team, and not individually.\nThe [Tech Memo Guidelines](PDF/TechMemoGuidelines2018.pdf) explains\nmore about the expected format. They may be submitted as .docx, .pdf, google doc, or hard copy.\n \n## Assignments, Labs, Exam, and Final Project\n\nSee the [Labs](labs.md.html) page for more details on the individual labs.\n\nSee the [Assignments](assignments.md.html) page for more details on the individual assignments.\n\nThe course is designed to\ntake about 12 hours per week total for in-class, lab, and reports. If you find any single\ntask is taking too long, contact Prof. Spjut to get help or the solution to that part.\nTeams (or the whole class) may work together and/or delegate to develop the information\nfor the reports, e.g., derivations, software models, plots, but each student must write up\nthe connecting material and explanation individually for Assignments 1 through 7, and Labs\n1, 2, 4, & 5.\n\n### Level 2 Exam\n\nTo both test your knowledge of the subject matter, and to prep you for certifying Level 2,\nwe will have a multiple-choice exam covering all of the questions in both the [Tripoli][Tri2]\nand [NAR][NAR2]\nstudy guides. It is due as Assignment 7. Practice exams and the\nfor-a-grade exam are available on Gradescope.\n\n### Final project\n\nMore details of the Final Project are found on the [Final Project](finalproject.md.html) page.\nWhat's given below is a general outline.\n\nFor your final project, you must include at a minimum:\n\n - Characterization of motor performance on each flight (the thrust curve, total and specific impulse)\n - Characterization of flight and flow dynamics on each flight ($C_D$ and vertical $a$,\n   $v$, and $z$).\n  \nIn addition, you may choose to demonstrate an in-depth understanding of either one of\nthe above areas or one of the following areas:\n\n - Characterization of avionics and telemetry\n - Characterization of structural dynamics \n - Fluid mechanics and CFD\n - Risk and reliability\n\n#### Project Proposal\n\n  By 29 February 2024, you need to submit a preliminary project plan. It must contain:\n  - Your preliminary objectives, i.e., answers to the questions:\n    -  What objectives do you have for your project?\n    -  What information or data do you need to have, e.g., acceleration, barometric altitude, rotation\n       rate, magnetic field, GPS coordinates, internal or external temperature, light intensity,\n       still or video images, or other sensor data; materials properties, planetary masses,\n       specific impulses, etc.?\n    -  How do you plan on acquiring the information or collecting the data?\n    -  Do you plan on any special or custom data processing or modeling?\n    -  Do you have any major modifications to be made to your rocket?\n    -  What questions do you expect your project to answer?\n  - The modeling, programming, or construction tools you expect to use.\n  - A preliminary project schedule.\n  \n  By 19 March 2024, you need to submit a final project proposal. It must contain:\n  - Your final objectives with supporting details.\n  - The modeling, programming, or construction tools you are going to use.\n  - A final project schedule with milestones and deliverables. See the course calendar\n    for the milestone dates.\n\n#### Final Report\n\nThe final draft of the Final Report is due 25 April 2024 by 11:50 p.m.\nThe [Tech Memo Guidelines](TechMemoGuide.md.html) explains\nmore about the expected format. It may be submitted as .docx, .pdf, google doc, or hard copy.\n\n# Level 1 & Level 2 Certification\nThis year, you will be constructing a Level-1 capable rocket, and a Level-2\ncapable rocket, and be graded on the quality of the construction and flight worthiness.\nIt is recommended that you certify, but it is not required. However, if your team wants\nto make major modifications to the Class Rocket for the final project, you both need to\nbe certified Level 2 by the end of Spring Break. A [guide to certification][cert] is [here][cert]. We\nwill discuss Level 1 and Level 2 certification in class.\n\n# Grading\n   Item         | Weight |\n---------------------------|---------------------|\nLabs:      | 30% (6% per report)|\nAssignments:      | 27% (3% per report)|\nFinal Project/Report: | 43%         |\n\n<!-- List of references -->\n[txt]:
