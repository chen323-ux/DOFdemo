{"title":"Lab 2 – Due 20240130","markdown":{"headingText":"Lab 2 – Due 20240130","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"**E178: Spring 2024 Labs**\n\n<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">|[home](index.html)|[syllabus](syllabus.html)|[assignments](assignments.html)|[labs](labs.html)|[final project](final_project.html)|[flight data](flight_data.html)|[getting certified](getting_certified.html)|</span>\n  \n  [**Preliminary Assembly Level 1**](labs/lab1.md.html) – Using proper technique assemble\n  the motor-tube - rings - shock-cord assembly and the payload/nose cone assembly\n  (Forward Section) of your Weasel kit. Prof. Spjut will inspect your assemblies on the due\n  date and immediately return them to you, so you can start on Final Assembly.\n\n  \n  [**Final Assembly Level 1**](labs/lab2.md.html) – Using proper technique\n  complete the assembly of your Weasel rocket. Also laser cut and \n  assemble the electronics bay support and mount and test the avionics. Prof. Spjut will\n  inspect your assemblies on the due date and immediately return them to you, so you can\n  finish ground testing and launch on 10 February 2024 at ROC if you desire.\n\n# Lab 3 – Due 20240206\n  \n  [**Fin Fillet Test**](labs/lab3.md.html) – Make sample fin joints with\n  fillets using fiberglass and epoxy, one with just epoxy, one with glass-microballoon\n  filler and one with milled glass-fiber filler. Perform destructive tests to determine\n  the strength of your joints.\n  \n  The results are in the [Lab 3 Link](labs/lab3.md.html)\n  \n!!! note\n    The destructive tests are scheduled 8 February 2024 in the MTS lab.\n\n# Lab 4 – Due 20240220\n  \n  [**Preliminary Assembly Level 2**](labs/lab4.md.html) – Using proper technique assemble\n  the motor-tube - rings -shock cord assembly, the GPS Bay/Nose Cone assembly, the GPS\n  Support and the Avionics Bay – forward body tube assembly\n  of your Vulcanite kit. You will not populate the avionics on either the GPS support or\n  the Avionics Bay for this lab. Prof. Spjut will inspect your assemblies on the due\n  date and immediately return them to you, so you can start on Final Assembly.\n\n\n# Lab 5 – Due 20240227\n  \n  [**Final Assembly Level 2**](labs/lab5.md.html) – Using proper technique\n  complete the assembly of your Vulcanite rocket. Populate and wire up your avionics bay\n  with the Eggfinder Quark and the Teensy Data Logger. Populate and wire up your\n  GPS Support. Prof. Spjut will\n  inspect your assemblies on the due date and immediately return them to you, so you can\n  finish ground testing and launch on 09 March 2024 at ROC if you desire.\n\n<!-- # Lab 6 – Due 20 March 2024\n  \n  [**Analysis of Weasel/Mini-DX3 Flight Data**](labs/lab6.md.html) – If you were able to fly your\n  LOC Weasel with the Featherweight GPS and the Small Teensy Data Logger, analyze the flight\n  data. If you were unable to fly your Weasel, use the Mini-DX3 flight data in the G77-10R/L and G79-10W/L data files.\n  in the [Flight Data](FlightData.md.html#flightdatafiles/madcowminidx3firstflight). Compare the\n  corrected barometric altitude with the GPS altitude and the predicted Open Rocket or\n  Rocksim altitude. Compare the measured/calculated acceleration and velocity with the\n  predicted Open Rocket or Rocksim acceleration and velocity. Compare the measured/calculated $C_D$\n  vs. $v$ with that from Open Rocket or Rocksim. Compare the measured/calculated thrust\n  curve with that from [Thrustcurve.org](https://www.thrustcurve.org). Comment on your\n  flight data as compared to the models and data from other sources. What have you learned?\n  What questions would you want to answer with further flights? -->\n  \n  <!-- My solution for Lab 6 is [here](labs/Lab6_Soln.pdf). -->\n  \n<!-- # Lab 7 – **A Victim of COVID**\n  \n  [**Analysis of Vulcanite Flight Data**](labs/lab7.md.html) – If you were able to fly your\n  Vulcanite with the Featherweight GPS and the Small Teensy Data Logger, analyze the flight\n  data. If you were unable to fly your Vulcanite, use the linked data files. Compare the\n  corrected barometric altitude with the GPS altitude and the predicted Open Rocket or\n  Rocksim altitude. Compare the measured/calculated acceleration and velocity with the\n  predicted Open Rocket or Rocksim acceleration and velocity. Compare the measured/calculated $C_D$\n  vs. $v$ with that from Open Rocket or Rocksim. Compare the measured/calculated thrust\n  curve with that from [Thrustcurve.org](https://www.thrustcurve.org).
