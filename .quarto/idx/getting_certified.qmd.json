{"title":"Why Certify?","markdown":{"headingText":"Why Certify?","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"**Rocketry Certification**\n<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">|[home](index.html)|[syllabus](syllabus.html)|[assignments](assignments.html)|[labs](labs.html)|[final project](final_project.html)|[flight data](flight_data.html)|[getting certified](getting_certified.html)|</span>\n\nE178, High-Power Rocketry previously has a pre- or co-requirement of either [NAR][NCRT] or [TRA][TCRT]\nLevel 1 certification and a strong recommendation of Level 2 certification. In stead of that\nrequirement, you will construct a Level-1 capable rocket and a Level-2\ncapable rocket, and be graded on the quality of the construction and flight worthiness,\nas well as pass an exam with all of the Level 2 exam questions for both organizations\non it. That way I am certain about your rocket-building ability, but we don't have to\nworry about the weather or launch cancellations\nIf you have access to a [TRA][TRA] or [NAR][NAR] launch site you are encouraged to do\nboth Level 1 and Level 2 certification.\nThe purpose of this page is to briefly explain the process for certification, and to provide\nlinks to additional resources.\n\nTo fly motors larger than a G, a person must be certified. Level 1 certification lets you fly\nrockets with H or I motors. Level 2 certification lets you fly J, K, and L motors. In California,\nLevel 3 certification lets you fly M motors. Outside of California, Level 3 lets you fly M and up.\n\n# TRA or NAR?\nTo become certified you must belong to either the Tripoli Rocketry Association [TRA][TRA] or\nthe National Association of Rocketry [NAR][NAR] and certify with [one][TCRT] or the [other][NCRT]\n(or both if you want). Either is acceptable and in general, if you are certified by one of\nthem, you can fly at a launch administered by the other of them. Here is a list of the \nmajor differences:\n* TRA is focused on high power rocketry and rocketry research, but they allow model rockets.\n  NAR is focused on model rocketry, but they support high power as well.\n\n* Certifying Level 1 with TRA requires that you have a Prefect observe the flight. Certifying\n  Level 1 with NAR requires that you are observed by any member with Level 2 certification.\n\n* NAR has many more member. TRA is a smaller community.\n\n* TRA's annual national launch is LDRS (Large and Dangerous Rocket Ships). NAR's annual launch\n  is NSL (National Sport Launch).\n\nOnce you've decided which to join, go to the relevant website and sign up. It is possible to join\non site, the day that you certify, but it's better to join a month or so before your certification\nflight. Tripoli describes membership [here][TMEM] and the actual sign-up form is [here][TFRM].\nNAR describes membership [here][NMEM] and the actual sign-up form is [here][NFRM].\n\nThe closest high-power rocketry club to Harvey Mudd College is\nthe [Rocketry Organization of California (ROC)][ROC]. In non-COVID-19 times they\nfly every month on the second Saturday at the [Lucerne Valley dry lake bed][ROCL]. They have a couple\nof TRA prefects and a large number of NAR observers. I strongly recommend you certify with them.\nThe high power on-site vendors keep changing due to economics and other factors. Check\nthe [Vendors List on the ROC website](https://rocstock.org/vendors/) to see who is likely to be on site.\n\n# Level 1\nThe detailed description of TRA's Level 1 certification process is [here][TL1].\nThe detailed description of NAR's Level 1 certification process is [here][NL1]. In short,\nthe process is:\n\n1. By yourself, build a rocket designed to fly on H impulse or I impulse motors.\n2. Prep the rocket for flight and prep the H or I motor for flight by yourself.\n3. Fly the rocket while the required observer is watching (at a sponsored event).\n4. Bring back the safely recovered rocket to the observer to verify that no damage\n   has occurred that would keep it from flying again.\n\n## Level 1 Strategy\nMost people trying to certify Level 1 build the simplest, least expensive (SLE) rocket they can that \nwill fly on a small H motor. The thinking is that once you are certified, you can experiment with\nmore complicated configurations, but the first order of business is to get certified. However,\nif you are a person who pays attention to detail and are willing to ground test before flight,\nyou can certify on a more complex, and more expensive rocket. My Level 1 rocket was fairly\nsimple but not particularly inexpensive. My Level 2 was much more complicated than most\npeople fly to certify, but it functioned perfectly.\n\nIf you choose your rocket carefully, you can certify both Level 1 and Level 2 on the same\nrocket (and on the same day, but most senior people recommend against same-day multi-certs).\n\n## Level 1 motor recommendations\nYou can certify on either an H or an I motor, but you cannot take possession of the motor until\njust before your flight. You can have someone already Level 1 or above (like Prof. Spjut)\nbuy it for you and give it to you when you're ready to prep for launch. Or you can buy it\nat the launch site when you're ready to prep for launch.\n\n### Aerotech or CTI?\nYou have three choices for a motor for a qualifying flight: An [Aerotech][AT] single-use motor,\nan [Aerotech][AT] reload, or a [CTI][CTI] reload. Both the Aerotech and CTI reloads require you to have\na motor case. Aerotech single-use motors are slightly more expensive than\neither brand of reload, but the CTI cases for the reloads are expensive, and the Aerotech cases\nfor the reloads are even more expensive. Prof. Spjut has cases you can borrow for the most common Aerotech sizes,\nand a case or two for CTI motors, so a reload with a borrowed case is the cheapest way to go.\nFor a SLE rocket, the top two choices are the Aerotech [H128W-14A][AH]\nreload and the CTI [H163-14A][CH] reload, but for SLE you can use any H reload that fits in the [Aerotech 29/180 case][A29]\nor any H reload that fits in the [CTI 29mm 3-grain case][C29]. Many vendors have a qualification discount\nfor your first HP motor for a qualifying flight.\n\n## Level 1 rocket recommendations\n\nThere are lots of rockets that will work for Level 1 and Level 2 qualification flights. By no\nmeans consider the list below to be exhaustive.\n\n### LOC Weasel\nYou will have to build one of these as part of the [first two labs](labs.md.html). It will easily let you\ncertify Level 1 (assuming you include the GPS Tracker) if you follow the construction techniques.\nIn addition to the [kit](https://locprecision.com/collections/rockets-1-63-diameter/products/weasel), you will need\nan Estes 29mm motor retainer and 5-minute epoxy. The perfect cert motor for this rocket\nis the Aerotech H128W. The class assembly instructions are [here](https://pages.hmc.edu/spjut/AdvRoc/CardboardWeaselRocketAssembly.md.html).\n\n### Madcow 1.6\" Mini DX3\nBefore the recent price hikes, this was the rockets built in the [first two labs](labs.md.html). It will easily let you\ncertify Level 1 (assuming you include the GPS Tracker) if you follow the construction techniques.\nIn addition to the [kit](https://www.madcowrocketry.com/1-6-mini-dx3/), you will need\nan Estes 29mm motor retainer and 5-minute epoxy. The perfect cert motor for this rocket\nis the Aerotech H128W. The former class assembly instructions are found [here](CardboardDX3RocketAssembly.md.html).\n\n### Estes Pro Series II\nThe least expensive way to certify Level 1 is to buy an [Estes Pro Series II][EPS] with a\n29 mm motor mount (not 24 mm) for\nbetween $20 and $40 and make the modifications to fly it on an H motor.\nThe [Super Big Bertha](https://estesrockets.com/products/super-big-bertha?_pos=1&_psq=super+big+bertha&_ss=e&_v=1.0)\nis an upscale of a classic Estes rocket and may be worth considering. If you can't get Pro Series II rocket\nfor around $20-to-$40, you're better off spending your\nmoney on the Madcow or one of the other rockets below.\n\nTo modify a Pro Series II for an H motor:\n  * Leave out the engine block on the motor mount if the kit has one.\n  * Put epoxy fillets on the fin joints.\n  * Replace the shock cord with 10 to 15 feet of kevlar and attach it to the motor mount or through the wall, not just glued on.\n  * Consider replacing the existing 1/4\" launch lugs with heftier 1/4\" launch lugs or rail guides.\n  \nThese rockets do not feature very rugged construction and will survive a few flights, but\ndon't plan on doing much more than qualifying on it. Available from [Estes][EPS], \n[eRockets](http://www.erockets.biz/pro/),\n[Sirius](https://www.siriusrocketry.biz/ishop/estes-pro-series-ii-kits-155/).\n\n### Aerotech Arreaux\nThe Aerotech Arreaux is an excellent SLE rocket. However, to fly H motors, you'll need to\nreplace the stock 12\" motor mount tube with a 15\" or ~18\" motor mount tube. See the construction\nhints [below](http://pages.hmc.edu/spjut/AdvRoc/RocketryCertification.md.html#constructionhints/aerotecharreaux).\nBeyond the kit and\nthe extra tube, all you need are CA adhesive\nand JB weld. We used modified Arreauxs in E80 for years. It's much sturdier than the Estes\nPro Series II, but not as sturdy as the Phobos, the Vulcanite, the Wildman Minis, or the Madcow thin-wall\nfiberglass. The rocket is available from [Wildman](https://wildmanrocketry.com/collections/aerotech-1-9-inch/products/arreaux),\n[eRockets](http://www.erockets.biz/aerotech-flying-model-rocket-kit-arreaux-w-alum-retainer-89013/),\n[Sirius](https://www.siriusrocketry.biz/ishop/aerotech-arreaux-739.html),\n[Apogee Components](https://www.apogeerockets.com/Rocket_Kits/Skill_Level_3_Kits/Arreaux?cPath=1_85&zenid=l6mkupg4hcvh3itqubmpe2u9t3).\nThe replacement motor mount tube is available from [Aerotech](https://www.aerotechstore.com/products/product_16e318e6-c2fd-e5a5-d053-3e84f31591c7),\nor [eRockets](http://www.erockets.biz/aerotech-motor-mount-tube-29-mm-x-17-3-4-inch-12918/).\n\n### PML Phobos\nThe PML Phobos is an extremely rugged and reliable kit. If you pay attention to the instructions\nand are careful during construction it will last for years. You will want the parachute upgrade\nand the HAMR motor retainer. If you get the 38mm motor mount instead of the 29mm, you can certify\nLevel 2 on it as well, but you'd want to make certain of your construction techniques and\nreplace the standard circular launch lugs with rail guides. Available from\n[LOC Precision](https://locprecision.com/collections/rockets-2-26-diameter/products/phobos),\n[eRockets](http://www.erockets.biz/public-missiles-pml-flying-model-rocket-kit-phobos/).\n\n### LOC Precision Vulcanite\nYou will build a Vulcanite as part of [Labs 4 and 5](labs.md.html).\nThe Vulcanite is a fairly rugged rocket that can be used for both Level 1 and Level 2 flights.\nIt's not quite as rugged as the PML Phobos. You'll want to order an Aero Pack Quick Change\nmotor retainer.\nSee building recommendations [below](#constructionhints/locprecisionvulcanite) if you want to try to cert\nLevel 2 on it as well, or\njust want a very well constructed rocket. If you go for your Level 2 with it, you'll want\nto use the Aerotech J270W-14A motor with 0.6g of BP.\nAvailable from [LOC Precision](https://www.locprecision.com/product/vulcanite-h76/),\n[Wildman](https://wildmanrocketry.com/products/vulcanite-h76),\n[eRockets](http://www.erockets.biz/loc-precision-flying-model-rocket-kit-vulcanite-h76-pk-52/),\n[Sirius](https://www.siriusrocketry.biz/ishop/loc-vulcanite-1805.html).\n\n### Wildman Mini\nAny of the Wildman Mini series rockets will work very well as a Level 1 qualifying rocket.\nThey are extremely sturdy and will last for years. Be sure to get the quick-change retainer.\nThe Nomex chute protector is also useful, but may only last a few flights. Consider the\ndual deploy upgrade if you don't want an SLE rocket. Available from\n[Wildman](https://wildmanrocketry.com/collections/wildman-mini).\n\n### Madcow\n[Madcow](https://www.madcowrocketry.com) has a number of rockets that will work for\nLevel 1 and Level 2 flights. The previous E190 Class Rocket\nwas a modified version of the Madcow Go Devil 38. However, the instructions are much less\ndetailed and are designed for more experienced builders. \nConsult Prof. Spjut if you would\nlike assistance with choosing a [Madcow](https://www.madcowrocketry.com) kit.\n\n### Apogee Components\nOne option to consider is the [Apogee Peregrine](https://www.apogeerockets.com/Rocket-Kits/Skill-Level-3-Model-Rocket-Kits/Peregrine).\nIt is designed for dual deploy and will also work as a Level 2 rocket should you decide\nto use it. It has an amazing set of videos on construction if you need a little guidance.\nThey also sell the [Zephyr](https://www.apogeerockets.com/Rocket-Kits/Skill-Level-3-Model-Rocket-Kits/Zephyr).\n\n# Level 2\nThe detailed description of TRA's Level 2 certification process is [here][TL2].\nThe detailed description of NAR's Level 2 certification process is [here][NL2]. In short,\nthe process is:\n\n1. By yourself, build a rocket designed to fly on J impulse, K impulse, or L impulse motors.\n2. Take and pass the Level 2 qualifying test. The TRA study guide is [here][T2SG] and the NAR study\n   guide is [here][N2SG]. An equivalent exam will be part of the Advanced Rocketry class.\n   The NAR exam consists of 37 questions taken from the list of questions. You must get 32\n   correct to pass (meaning you can miss up to 5 questions). The TRA exam consists of 50\n   questions taken from the list of questions. You must get 45\n   correct to pass (meaning you can miss up to 5 questions).\n2. Prep the rocket for flight and prep the J, K, or L motor for flight by yourself.\n3. Fly the rocket while the required observer is watching (at a sponsored event).\n4. Bring back the safely recovered rocket to the observer to verify that no damage\n   has occurred that would keep it from flying again.\n   \n# Level 3\nConsult the relevant website. We will not focus on Level 3 in Advanced Rocketry\n\n# Level 1 Checklist\n  [ ] Join either TRA or NAR. Best to do a month before flight.\n  [ ] Construct yor rocket by yourself. Follow the hints below if using one of my recommendations.\n  [ ] Weigh your completed rocket and find the center of mass fully loaded ('chute, electronics, etc) but _without_ the motor.\n  [ ] Use either Rocksim/Open Rocket or the kit information to locate and label the _Center of Pressure_ (CP). The symbol is a circle with a dot in the middle, <big>☉</big>.\n  [ ] Decide on the motors you might use.\n  [ ] Using Rocksim/Open Rocket and your measured mass and CM, determine the optimal delay. The delays on the motors can be adjusted\n      downwards (but not upwards) in 2-second increments.

It’s worth buying an extra-length motor-mount tubes to cert level 1. A length of at\n   least 15\" will work for Aerotech 29/180 or shorter motors. _You'll need to fiberglass your rocket\n   to fly motors with more than 180 Ns of impulse_. You will need a length of at\n   least 16¼\" for the H115DM-14A, the H182R-14A, the H135W-14A, and the H195NT-14A, and a\n   length of at least 19¾\" for the I205W-14A. For the extra-length motor mount tube, you can either order\n   the replacement motor mount tube  from [Aerotech](https://www.aerotechstore.com/products/product_16e318e6-c2fd-e5a5-d053-3e84f31591c7),\n   or [eRockets](http://www.erockets.biz/aerotech-motor-mount-tube-29-mm-x-17-3-4-inch-12918/).\n2. You won't need the 24 mm motor adaptor and don't need to construct it. Most of the parts\n   are no longer in the kit.\n3. You need to attach the included motor retainer instead of the Motor Hook, Thrust Ring,\n   and Thrust Ring Flange. These changes are detailed in the Arreaux Motor Retainer Upgrade\n   Notice. Attaching the motor retainer should be done AFTER the rest of the rocket construction\n   is completed (after Step 1 of the FINAL ASSEMBLY AND FINISHING in the instructions), otherewise\n   it will block the application of the cyannoacrylate to the fin roots and the aft Centering Ring.\n   Use JB Weld to attach it. The details are in the Aerotech 29 mm Motor Retainer Instructions\n   (all on the Aerotech website <http://www.aerotech-rocketry.com/resources.aspx?id=4> near the bottom of the page).\n4. Use tapped holes and threaded #6 nylon screws to secure the nosecone to the payload section.\n   Two is the minimum, three is recommended, four is allowed. Friction fitting with tape isn't sufficient.\n5. It's often useful to be able to replace either the body or the payload/nosecone. The recessed\n   screw eye on the payload section makes it difficult. You may want to make an extension out of\n   1/8\" rope and a quik-link and attache the shock cord to the quik-link.\n6. Make sure you can dry-fit the fins BEFORE you CA them in place. You may need to sand down\n   the ridges a little to be able to snap the fins into place.\n7. Other suggestions are on the [old E80 website](https://pages.hmc.edu/spjut/RocketE80/RocketLaunchLab.html).\n\n## LOC Precision Vulcanite\nThe [build instructions](VulcaniteRocketAssembly.md.html) for [Labs 4 and 5](labs.md.html)\nalready incorporate most of the hints below.\n1. Be sure to roughen all surfaces to be epoxied, with 60, 80, or 100 grit sandpaper **before** you glue so\n   that the epoxy adheres better.\n2. Get an Aero Pack RA 38mm L motor retainer.\n3. Sand the bottom 3/8\" of the motor mount tube until the motor retainer slides on easily.\n4. Replace the elastic shock cord in the kit with 12 ft to 15 ft of either tubular/strap nylon or tubular/strap Kevlar,\n   such as PML STRP-0.375, eRockets ER9044, Wildman [KEVLAR1/4\"](https://wildmanrocketry.com/collections/kevlar/products/kevlar1-4), or Madcow SC_FLT_38_RED.\n5. Use either the PML mounting style or the Modified PML mounting style for the shock cord. For the PML style,\n   follow steps 1 & 2 in the [Phobos Instructions](https://publicmissiles.com/secure/images/Phobosinstructionbooklet.pdf).\n   You'll have to machine or file a notch in one of the centering rings to accomodate the shock cord.\n   The centering ring on the other end (held in place with tape), must be **at least** 3/8\"\n   from the end of the motor mount tube and preferably 1/2\" to accomodate the motor retainer.\n   When assembled, the motor mount will protrude from the end of the rocket a bit. The modified\n   PML style is similar, but instead of epoxying the shock cord axially to the motor mount, it is\n   tied radially around the motor mount tube and included in the epoxy fillet between the \n   motor mount tube and the centering ring. Step 2 of the Madcow [Batray instructions](https://www.madcowrocketry.com/content/pdf/batray.pdf)\n   show the tying technique, but has the notch on the outside of the centering ring instead\n   of on the inside where it belongs. \n6. If you want streamlined fins, round the leading edge, and taper the trailing edge. Leave\n   the inside and outside edges square.\n7. Consider laser-cutting a pair of fin guides to ensure the fins are perpendicular to the body tube.\n8. Use the PML technique to attach the fins as shown in Step 4 of the [Phobos Instructions](https://publicmissiles.com/secure/images/Phobosinstructionbooklet.pdf).\n   When you finally epoxy in the bottom centering ring, push it flush up against the fins.\n9. When prepping the Payload Bay, consider finding a screw eye that attaches with a nut and washer\n   rather than just a wood-screw end.\n10. When you epoxy in the coupler tube bulkhead, recess it at least 1/8\" so that you can put\n    a decent fillet between the bulkhead and the coupler tube on the outside. **DO NOT make\n    the bulkhead flush with the end of the coupler tube.** The LOC instructions say to, but\n    they are seriously wrong and you may lose your payload section when the recovery charge goes off.\n11. Secure the nose cone to the payload section with three countersunk #4 flat head screws.\n    You can use the pan head screws but they don't sit as flush.\n12. If you are planning on Level 2 (J) flights, either replace or supplement the launch lugs\n    with rail guides, either [PML LRL-10-2](https://publicmissiles.com/product/hardware) or [Acme 54mm](https://giantleaprocketry.com/products/components_launch_systems.aspx#Acme_Conformal_Launch_Guides).\n13. Secure the motor retainer with JB Weld.\n\n[TRA]: http://www.tripoli.org\n[TMEM]: http://www.tripoli.org/Membership\n[TFRM]: https://www.tripoli.org/content.aspx?page_id=60&club_id=795696\n[TCRT]:
